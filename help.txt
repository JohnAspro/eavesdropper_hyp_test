#Trained only with PARTIAL(p) observation legit vector
	(DQN | PPO)_p_balanced: equal focus a = b 
	(DQN | PPO)_p_adv/ : bigger focus on minimizing the adversary vector max (b>a)
	(DQN | PPO)_p_leg/: looking to maximize fast the legitimate vector first (a>b) 

#Trained with FULL(f) observation legit vector and adversary vector
